# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Folium only supports the most recent version of the package. We strive to maintain backwards compatibility in new versions, so we recommend users to always update to the latest version. Support for older versions is currently not provided.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Reporting Process: Please report any security issues by creating an Issue on our GitHub repository. Or better yet, open a PR with a fix.
- Private Reporting: If you believe that publicly sharing an issue could lead to significant harm, you may opt for a private report at https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/security.
- Response Time: We will strive to respond promptly to all reported issues, prioritizing them based on severity. However, please understand that as volunteers, our response times may vary.
- No Guarantees: While we are committed to addressing security concerns to the best of our abilities, we do not provide any guarantees regarding resolution times or outcomes.
